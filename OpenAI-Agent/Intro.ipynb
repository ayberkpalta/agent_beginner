President Donald Trump stated that these actions \"completely and totally obliterated\" Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities. However, initial assessments suggest that while above-ground structures were damaged, underground facilities and centrifuges may have only been delayed by a few months.

On June 17, amid escalating conflicts, Pahlavi declared that the current Iranian regime was collapsing and urged citizens to \"rise\" and \"reclaim\" Iran.

This environment facilitated the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, who promised to restore Germany’s power and pride.\\n\\n2. **Rise of Totalitarian Regimes:** In the 1930s, aggressive totalitarian regimes came to power in Germany, Italy (under Mussolini), and Japan, each pursuing expansionist policies.\\n\\n3. **Expansionist Policies:**\\n   - **Germany:** Following the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the annexation of Austria in the Anschluss (1938), Hitler turned his attention to Czechoslovakia and later, Poland.\\n   - **Italy:** Invaded Ethiopia in 1935.\\n   - **Japan:** Expanded its influence in East Asia, notably invading Manchuria in 1931 and China in 1937.\\n\\n4. **Appeasement:** Initially, European powers, particularly Britain and France, adopted a policy of appeasement, allowing Hitler to expand German territory with little opposition, hoping to avoid another large-scale conflict.\\n\\n5. **The Munich Agreement (1938):** Britain and France agreed to allow Germany to annex the Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia, hoping this concession would secure peace.\\n\\n6. **Nazi-Soviet Pact (1939):** Also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, this non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union secretly divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, enabling Germany to invade Poland without fear of Soviet intervention.\\n\\nThese factors combined to set the stage for global conflict, transforming regional tensions into World War II.'"
